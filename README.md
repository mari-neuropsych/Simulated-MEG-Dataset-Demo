# Jupyter-MEG-Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for exploring MEG data using the MNE-Python library.  
The notebooks show step-by-step how to:
- Load example MEG data directly from MNE sample datasets  
- Access the raw data as NumPy arrays  
- Visualize and inspect channel values and time points  
- Convert signals into pandas DataFrames for easier handling  

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- MNE-Python
- NumPy
- pandas

## Notes
These notebooks are meant for practice and learning purposes, focusing on MEG signal exploration inside Jupyter.
